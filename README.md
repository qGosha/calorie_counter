I built this app based on free version of nutrition API in order to learn Redux and its uses with React. This is simple calorie-counter allows a user to track consumed food. User can search food then add it to your basket, modify quantity and serving size, log food to your food log. The calendar component gives a user the opportunity to track his progress on not exceeding the daily calorie limit.
